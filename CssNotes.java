Easy CSS Interview Questions

Q1. What is the full form of CSS? 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
 It is a technology developed by the World Wide Web Consortium or W3C. It was developed
 to streamline the styling of webpages into a separate technology.
 
 Q2. Why was CSS developed?
CSS was first developed in 1997 as a way for web developers to define the visual appearance of the web pages that they were creating. It was intended to allow developers to separate the content and structure of a website’s code from the visual design, something that had not been possible prior to this time.

The separation of structure and style allows HTML to perform more of the function that it was originally based on — the markup of content, without having to worry about the design and layout of the page itself, something commonly known as the “look and feel” of the page.

body {
  background-image: url("img_tree.gif");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
